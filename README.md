# Bracu-Duburi-Interview-Task

## The repository contains code and other stuff for the task that was given to me during Bracu Duburi interview process.


### followed all the instructions that were given to me for the task.<br>

* Used custom dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/water-bottle-dataset/)
* Labeled and cleaned the dataset using [LabelImg](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg)
* used SSD MobileNet Model specifically **SSD MobileNet v2 320x320**

### you can run my trained model locally on custom dataset by following the steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Edit all the file paths according to your filesystem ( mainly test.py )
3. Use virtual enviroment to clone python enviroment in which all the scripts and stuff works using **requirements.txt**
4. Run *test.py* & have fun detecting bottles :)

## Best part, seeing your model acutally do something, here you go:
